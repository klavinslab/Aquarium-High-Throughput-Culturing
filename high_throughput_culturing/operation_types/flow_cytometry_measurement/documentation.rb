This protocol will instruct you on how to take measurements on the #{flow_cytometer.type} Flow Cytometer.
A flow cytomter uses lasers to phenotypically characterize a microbial culture.
This per cell measurement quantifies a cell's size, shape, and color. Making it a useful tool to analyze & distiguish cellular populations from each other.
In this protocol, you will prepare the instrument workspace and characterize your genetically modified organism.

    1. Setup flow_cytometer.type Flow Cytomter Software workspace.
    
    2. Check to see if input item is a flow_cytometer.valid_containers if not, transfer samples to a valid container.
    
    3. Load plate.
    
    4. Take measurement, export data, & upload.
