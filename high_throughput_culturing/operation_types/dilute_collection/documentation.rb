    1. Gather materials.
    
    2. Pre-fill new plate with media, if necessary.
    
    3. Transfer aliquot of culture to new plate.
    
    4. Incubate.


This operation takes in a collection and dilutes the microbial cultures found in it by a user specified dilution factor. It requires that the output container have a `Data` association {'working_vol': '1000_uL'} in order for the dilution to be computed.
