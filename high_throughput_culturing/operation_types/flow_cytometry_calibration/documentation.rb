To compare different experiments against each other we must have a way to compare the fluorescence intensities across different flow cytometers.
To achieve this we will be using small beads that fluoresce multiple colors.

    1. Setup flow cytometer workspace and measure bead sample.
    
    2. Take chosen beads and dilute, if necessary.
    
    3. Upload .fcs file to Aquarium.
