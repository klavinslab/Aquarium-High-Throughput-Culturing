This operation takes in a culture plate collection applies a reagent, timestamps the collection, and passes it as an output. The operation uses the experimental condition chosen by the user as a key. The key is then used to generate data structures for displaying specific wells in a collection. Furthermore, the key is also used to fetch how much volume of the experimental condition item (ie: inducers or antibiotics) each well requires. Future directions may be to include using the Option(s) key to apply custom experimental conditions (ie: Ethanol, Cellular Stain). The option(s) parameter can be input into the Define Culture Conditions operation as a JSON parsable object.
